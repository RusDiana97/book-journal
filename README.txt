The "Book Journal" website was created because I like to read a lot. I thought that a list of the books I've read is a good idea to keep track of them. I structured and styled the website with HTML and CSS. Moreover, I developed a program for adding a new book to the existing list and for calculating the total price of the books in the list.

In the 'screenshots' folder there are screens with the website.

In the 'video' folder there is a video that shows the functionality of the website.

# Book Journal ðŸ“–

**Book Journal** is actually a collection of already read books.

It offers the possibility of entering a new read book in a table with existing books with the following characteristics:

- title
- author
- price (RON)
- date of purchase

***The total price of the books will be automatically updated every time another book is added to the list, so you will always know how much money you have spent on books in total.***

**Book Journal** also offers a section for *your favorite book* that includes the title of the book, the author and a short description of it.
